## 1. About

More and more IT companies are planning or already on the way to make the transition,
which from the traditional software development process to [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) process.

This article is my personal learning notes for Agile learning and practice.

## 2. What is the Agile?

Agile is just a set of **principles** and **values**, which focus on customer collaboration and iterative working software delivery by the self-organizing cross-function teams.

### 2.1 What are the Agile principles?

Agile defines **12 principles** for software development,

<pre class="km-container" minder-data-type="markdown" style="height: 500px">

- 12 Agile principles
  - Customer collaboration
    - 1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
    - 2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development
  - Self-organizing cross-function teams
    - 1. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
    - 2. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
    - 3. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
    - 4. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
    - 5. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
    - 6. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
  - Working software delivery
    - 1. Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
    - 2. Working software is the principal measure of progress
    - 3. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
    - 4. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly

### 2.2 What are the Agile values?

Per above principles, Agile clarifies its **values** by following **Agile manifesto**,

* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan
* Individuals and interactions over process and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation

### 2.3 Why Agile?

Agile is good at handling following type of uncertainties and complexities of projects,

* Business or requirements are not clear and complex.
* Technical are risky or uncertain.
* People uncertainties: distrust, conflicts, bad communications, and lack of collaborations.

## 3 What is the Scrum?

[Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) is an **iterative** and **incremental** agile software development method。

### 3.1 Agile VS. Scrum: what is the difference?

Scrum is just one of practices/methods/frameworks of Agile.

As we mentioned before, Agile is just a set of **principles** and **value**, people have created many methods under the Agile Umbrella.
For example, [Extreme programming (XP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming),
[Lean software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development),
[Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)),
and [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))。

### 3.2 Three Roles

There are three core roles in the Scrum framework. These core roles are ideally colocated to deliver potentially shippable Product Increments
