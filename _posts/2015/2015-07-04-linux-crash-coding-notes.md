## Crash coding notes

### 1. Where could I found coding examples?

See [crash whitepaper](http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash_whitepaper), **Command Extensions** section.
This document also has crash command usages and a case study for kernel debugging.
Please study it carefully before working on crash.

###2. Public APIs defined in defs.h

Crash public APIs are defined in defs.h. 

* Don not change existing APIs in defs.h
* The code changes in defs.h should not break the 3rd party crash extension source code build
* If changes can be put into private files, don not change in defs.h
* Make code changes in defs.h as simple as possible.

###3. Other coding and testing guidelines

* Run "make warn" to fix all warnings.

* It would be better, if variables, APIs, and CLI output naming could reflect kernel data structure naming.

* CLI changes should also add man page changes in help.c

* Test must be done on both 32 and 64 bit kernels

* Per your code changes, need to consider the test on different kernel versions

* If you don not have enough test resources, please discuss with maintainer to leverage community test resources.

* Before sending out the patch, please make sure your changes is on top of latest upstream patch

###4. Build and test environment setup

Make sure you had installed following packages. I used Fedora CLIs as examples.

* Basic development tools

      sudo yum -y groupinstall "Development Tools"

* patch

      sudo yum install -y patch

* ncurses-devel

      sudo yum install -y ncurses-devel

* zlib-devel

      sudo yum install -y zlib-devel

* bison and byacc

      yum install -y bison
      yum install â€“y byacc

* kernel debug info packages, if required.

  for 64 bit x86 kernel,

      debuginfo-install kernel

  for 32 bit x86 kernel,

      debuginfo-install kernel-PAE
